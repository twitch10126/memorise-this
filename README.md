**Overview**

"Memorise This" is an interactive memory game designed to test the players skills and quick reflexes. The game presents users with an increasingly complex sequence of colors and sounds that they must recall and repeat. As players progress, the difficulty increases, requiring more focus and stronger memorization abilities. It is designed to increase in difficulty, so players of all levels can participate whether they are beginners looking for a little entertainment or experienced players looking for a mental workout.
